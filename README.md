## inDrop_analysis
assembled pipelines for scRNA-seq analysis based on the inDrop system

TEST LINE from cmnd line

# 1 run inDrop pipeline to produce sparse matrix

# 2 transform sparse matrix to dense matrix

# 3 run SCatter on the raw data to filter out damaged cells and normalize reads

# 4 run SEURAT on normalized and QC verified data

# 5 Custom additional R analysis on scRNA-seq data
